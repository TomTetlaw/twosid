Once upon a time there was an idiot named thomas tetlaw who conmplained constantly about being tired even though it was ALL HIS FAULT for not going to bed early because he could not stop himself from rendering. So as the helpful girlfriend I am, I rendered his ass to bed so that he could at least have some hours fo rest before he had to arise for his day of work and restart the whole cycle of complaining.
