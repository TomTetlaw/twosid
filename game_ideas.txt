magic:

radiation!

either sorcerer-style (evil):
	- use items and books to focus and power magic spells
	- high power floor but limited ceiling
	- more explicitly told to the player

or hunter-style (good):
	- magic power scales with asceticism
	- player actions and items in inventory get an "asceticism score"
	- scale magic power based on total score
	- low power floor but very high ceiling
	- eg. drinking and prostitution = WEAK MAGIC 
	- eg. no items, minimal clothes, spends time in prayer = GOD MODE
	- not told to the player explicitly
